I have been working on this Project for past 6 days, and I call it Dashpro
Hope you will like it-

to run the project, simply unzip the file in any code editor of your choice,
1)run-

pip install -r requirements.txt ( to install dependencies mentioned in requirement.txt

2) venv\Scripts\activate ( in order to activate virtual environment)
3)cd dashpro
4) python manage.py runserver ( in order to runserver)
5) from terminal, go to the port mentioned in the runserver

You can access various pages, including HOME which has the analytics and charts which are based on data
fetched from MongoDB cluster.

also you would find a "Filtering" page in the sidebar, where you can see the database and filter according
to your requirements.

You can also find my Github link in the 'Something About Me' Page.
